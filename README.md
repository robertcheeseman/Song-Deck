# Getting Started with Song Deck

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Song Deck was written to fetch a random song from Spotify's API and return it to the listener for them to either dislike/skip the song or like/save the song... think of it as a dating app but for music!

In order for this to successfully work after you've cloned the repository, you'll have to make sure you have a free Spotify Developer Account ( https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/ ) in order to create your own Client ID and Secret Key to access the Spotify API.  Once you have these, you can paste them into a .env file or directly into 'search.js' in this snippet of code:

// Spotify Access
  
const clientID = process.env.REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
  
const secretID = process.env.REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_KEY

That should be it!  Happy hunting for that next favorite song of yours!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
